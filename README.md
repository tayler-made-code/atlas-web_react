- You must use jQuery to add the elements to the body of the page.
- When running Webpack, your javascript and html files should be generated in a dist folder.
- You should not use a custom webpack config file.
- Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
- Your html code should only import one Javascript script (the one generated by webpack).
- Do NOT push your dist/main.js if you have one.
